## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi there! I'm Ayushi Malhotra, a passionate and driven full-stack developer with a keen interest in creating efficient, scalable, and innovative software solutions. My journey in the world of technology has taken me from the bustling offices of Oracle to the serene academic halls of Dalhousie University, where I'm currently honing my craft as a Master's student in Applied Computer Science.

Whether it's architecting microservices, optimizing backend performance, or crafting sleek, user-friendly interfaces, I'm always up for a challenge. My toolkit is vast, ranging from Java to JavaScript, from Spring Boot to React.js, and from Docker to Kubernetes. But beyond the code, I believe in the power of collaboration, the importance of continuous learning, and the joy of building something that can make a difference.
